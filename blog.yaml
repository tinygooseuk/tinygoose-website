    It's 2020! The world is all a bit upside-down! But I've done a new site!
    <br/><br/>
    It should be much easier to update and to post on, and so you can expect more frequent updates on here, which is cool.
    I also updated our logo and name a little bit, just to jazz things up a bit.
    <br/><br/>
    In terms of news, I recently worked on a 3-hour game jam, [TriJam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-62). Our entry didn't win,
    or even come close really - but it was great fun to fully unfurl a game idea in just 3 hours, and then see someone
    play it on a live stream! 
    <br/><br/>
    For now, I'm working on that game jam game in spare time to make it into a decent arcade experience that you can play
    on PC and hopefully also on mobile (it almost works!). So stay tuned!

- title: 12 Months, 12 games?!
  posted: 2019-07-28
  author: Joe Flood
  content: <div>So, I started off this year with a challenge to myself: make 12 games in a year; one per month.</div><div><br></div><div>The idea behind this was to keep myself motivated while throwing out a few projects on itch.io so that people could get to know me and what I'm capable of creating. <br></div><div><br></div><div>This was also meant to help me get a job at a "proper studio", by building up my portfolio while also gaining experience shipping games and working on parts of games that I otherwise wouldn't.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So all in all, this started incredibly well, and I'm really proud of the first 5 games I made. Problem is, I've had trouble delivering them lately, and that's basically because I have again lost the motivation to create a project from scratch each month in Unreal, work on it, then release it via itch. <br></div><div><br></div><div>It's actually a very tedious process which goes a bit like this:</div><div><ul><li>Create a project in Unreal Project Manager</li><li>Set the project up</li><li>Set the editor up for the project<br></li><li>Switch off various plugins in Unreal for Git, VR, etc.<br></li><li>Change all source files to have proper copyrights</li><li>Check into source control</li><li>Set up source control plugin for Visual Studio</li><li>Set up source control in Unreal<br></li><li>Create various boilerplate classes</li><li>Add modules for various Unreal subsystems that aren't enabled by default (e.g. UI support!!)<br></li><li><b>... actually make the game ...</b></li><li>Add a pause menu</li><li>Add credits</li><li>Add a main menu</li><li>Add quality settings<br></li><li>Add quit functionality</li><li>Export the game &amp; test it<br></li><li>Create itch.io project page &amp; set up</li><li>Set theme of itch.io page to match other games</li><li>Take and upload screenshots and/or video<br></li><li>Upload binary to itch.io</li><li>Post to this blog (hi!)</li><li>Post to Facebook, Twitter, etc.<br></li><li>Retweet/Share own post on social media<br></li><li>Upload source code to github</li><li><br></li></ul><div>As you can see, the "making the game" part is very tiny. A huge portion of it is "Unreal boilerplate" and a lot of it is getting the game presentable and ready for release. So that sucks. Plus, I recently <b>did</b> get that dream job in a "proper studio" (yay &#128513;!), which has taken a <b>lot</b> of my time and energy (boo &#128078;!).</div></div><div><br></div><div>So here's what I'm proposing. No more 1-game-per-month as it stands. Instead, I'll work on my long term project, slowly chipping away at it with the intention of releasing a demo in some number of month's time (nice and non-commital, right?). I'll also explore prototypes as I have been doing, but at my own pace and probably in other software packages (I've been playing with Godot recently - it seems pretty damn amazing!).<br></div><div><br></div><div>How's that sound?</div><div><br></div><div>On the more positive side, over the past 7 months I've levelled up my experience in the following technical skills:</div><div><ul><li>VR - locomotion/teleport systems, hand manipulation, VR level and sound design</li><li>Procedural generation of levels and the challenges faced</li><li>Custom shaders/materials for UI and how best to apply them</li><li>Animations in UMG</li><li>How to make plugins in Unreal</li><li>Paper2D - 2D sprite(sheet) support in Unreal</li><li>How to make AI that responds to user input</li><li>Text input using the "Game Viewport" class</li><li>Data structures in blueprint and C++</li><li>Sub-levels and level streaming, custom level loading tech</li><li>Physics constraints (ropes/springs)</li><li>Character animations</li><li>More advanced particle effects</li></ul><div><br></div><div>But, perhaps more importantly, I've learned the following:</div><div><ul><li>How to create, polish, and release a game on itch.io from start to finish</li><li>How to connect with "influencers", and bump up a game's visibility</li><li>How to take note of feedback, act upon it, and communicate with players</li><li>How to effectively communicate via blog posts and social media, and how to coordinate information release</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Not as cool as the first list, but will prove <b>super </b>useful when the time comes to ship my big game project and support it.</div><div><br></div><div>So for now, no more cool prototypes (unless they're made in Godot or Unity!), and no fixed timelines for them. However, I'll pour the new found time into working on my "real" project, which will hopefully see the light of day (or a demo) soonâ„¢.</div><div><br></div><div align="center">- Joe -<br></div></div></div></div>

  content: <div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">Okay - so I missed May entirely. Sorry about that, busy life and all that! I'll see if I can sneak in an extra game on one of the other months... let's see! Anyway, without further ado I present to you game &#35;5 of 12 in my 12 month challenge - "Bok"!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;">So what's this Bok you ask? Bok is a game about a chicken who has had all of his Golden Eggs stolen by some Bad Guy, and must retrieve them by... uhh... yeeting them off the edge of each level. This is done by flapping, which incidentally is the only thing Bok is able to do. That and accidentally fall off levels, of course!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;"><br></div></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">May and June's game was inspired by the desire to make a one-button game that was still somewhat compelling. I also wanted to take the opportunity to use "data tables" in a game to promote easier customisability, and I wanted to create every single asset in the game myself. That last bit didn't happen, as I soon realised I couldn't make music myself - at least without delaying the game further. Also some effects/shaders and such were 3rd party - the credits lays this out fairly clearly though, so head on over there if you want to see which parts I cheaped out on &#128540;!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;"><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Anyway, enough rambling - if you want to give it a spin, take a look at:<a href="https://tinygoose.itch.io/bok" title="https://tinygoose.itch.io/bok" target="_blank">&nbsp;https://tinygoose.itch.io/bok</a>!</span></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">And if you feel nosey/adventurous/intrigued, the full source code is also available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tinygooseuk/bok" title="" target="" style="font-size: 21.33px;">https://github.com/tinygooseuk/Bok</a><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">. As usual, you won't be able to build and run the game from there as it's missing the project files and assets, but you can see how it was done!</span></div><div align="center" style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div align="center" style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">- Joe -</div></div>

  content: <div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">With just minutes left of April, I present to you game &#35;4 of 12 in my 12 month challenge - "Verball Abuse"!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;">So what's Verball Abuse? Why two L's? Well, this is not a game about abuse at all, but rather it's a football game - but with a twist: the only input available to you is your keyboard - more specifically, you can only type football-themed words to influence your team's shots.</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;"><br></div></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">April's game was inspired by a game I saw at EGX Rezzed - an actual football game! This game is very much nothing like normal football and is more of a proto<b>type</b>.</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">Get it? Proto-<b>type</b>. Typing? No? Moving on...</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">So yeah, that's the game. I made it because I'd never had the interest in making a football game before and wanted to try making a sports game with a bit of a twist. In the process I levelled up my skills in the following:</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal;"><ul style=""><li style="font-size: 21.33px;">AI - both teams are fully AI-controlled until the typing prompts appear, at which point a custom time dilation solution kicks in</li><li style="font-size: 21.33px;">Custom data structures via blueprint - for the database of football words<br></li><li style="font-size: 21.33px;">Paper2D sprites and flipbooks - for the (horrendous!) player sprites</li><li style=""><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">Using a custom&nbsp;</span><font face="courier new" style="" size="2"><b>UGameViewportClient </b></font><span style="font-size: 21.33px;">subclass to capture raw input (i.e. keypresses)</span></li></ul></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">Anyway, enough rambling - if you want to give it a spin, take a look at:&nbsp;<a href="https://tinygoose.itch.io/verball-abuse" title="" target="">https://tinygoose.itch.io/verball-abuse</a>!<br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">And if you feel nosey/adventurous/intrigued, the full source code is also available at: <a href="https://github.com/tinygooseuk/VerballAbuse" title="" target="">https://github.com/tinygooseuk/VerballAbuse</a>.

  content: <div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">At long last, I present to you game &#35;3 of 12 in my 12 month challenge - "Minesweeper VR"!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">March's game was actually made throughout February and March 2019, so it's another slightly cheeky entry. However, I feel that the level of polish I've been able to apply to it justifies the time spent!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">So what is it? Well surely you must remember the old "Minesweeper" computer game from Windows 95, right? No? Well, it's a very basic puzzle where you click around a grid trying to uncover mines without actually setting them off. Sounds simple, but it's really pretty tough! In my version of this classic game, the grid is mounted onto a cube, adding a 3rd dimension (3D &#128561;!) into the mix.</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">Anyway, enough rambling - if you want to give it a spin, take a look at:&nbsp;<a href="https://tinygoose.itch.io/minesweeper-vr" title="" target="">https://tinygoose.itch.io/minesweeper-vr</a>!</div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;"><br></div><div style="font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-size: 21.33px;">And if you feel nosey/adventurous/intrigued, the full source code is also available at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tinygooseuk/Minesweeper-VR" title="" target="">https://github.com/tinygooseuk/Minesweeper-VR</a>.

And since I've been struggling to finish the "real" February game (it's another VR demo with some very complicated interactions &#128556;), this will hold the fort for another month. Expect to see more exciting stuff in March!</div><div style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Patrick Hand",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 21.33px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'><br></div><div style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Patrick Hand",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 21.33px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'>So what is it? Well, Pipe Dream is a simple Arcade-style spaceship-flying, obstacle-dodging racing game where you must pilot a spaceship from one end of a pipe to the other without crashing and burning (Arcade Mode), or challenge up to 3 other local players to a race against the clock (Race Mode).</div><div style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Patrick Hand",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 21.33px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'><br></div><div style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Patrick Hand",Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 21.33px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;'>Of note, this game features fully randomly generated pipes, which are created from a palette of a handful of crafted pipe sections.

# 12 games of 2019 intro
- title: 2019 - One game every month!
  posted: 2019-01-20
  author: Joe Flood
  content: <div>Happy new year everyone!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, back in December I made a really quick prototype game for a game jam. It never got entered in the end, because I realised I didn't have enough spare time at the right moments to get it finished and polished. So, I spent a few days after the deadline just finishing it off and then after that, released the source code on GitHub.</div><div><br></div><div>The game grossed a total of... $2 on itch.io, which is... fine. I had a tonne of fun making it and going through the process of releasing it into the wild (and of course, it was never about the money!) Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed finding the time to work on the project to completion and it felt great to add something to my portfolio.</div><div><br></div><div>So, here comes this year's ambitious resolution - I'm going to do it all over again, <u>every single month in 2019</u>. That's right, new game every month. I'll be working on each prototype/demo/game for anything between a few hours and a couple of weeks each month - whatever I have time for after "adult commitments".</div><div><br></div><div>Let's see how it goes! This month's project, to be released not after 31st January, is... <i>drumroll please...</i> a VR game!</div><div><br></div><div>VR is becoming a bigger market each year, and it's so fun to make something you can literally jump into. (Plus, if this first month is a total flop, less people will know about it <b>;D</b>) For my project, I'll be making something a bit like the old PS1 game, "<a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Blank_(1994_video_game)" target="">Point Blank</a>". It was an arcade shooter game from the 90s which involved a number of minigames where you had to shoot various things and avoid other things.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Stay tuned!</div><div align="center"><br></div><div align="center">- Joe -</div>

# Really old
- title: GroundHog

  content: <div>Finally an update!</div><div><br></div><div>So a while back I decided I wanted to enter a game jam, so I can see how well I can make simple games to a deadline. Turns out, I missed the submission date for the Epic MegaJam 2018, so... looks like I'm not great at making simple games to a deadline &#128556;!</div><div><br></div><div>Either way, I created a simple platformer over the course of about 5 days, as if it were for a game jam. I then posted it to <a title="/r/unrealengine" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine" target="">/r/unrealengine</a>, and to <a title="itch.io" href="https://tinygoose.itch.io/groundhog" target="">itch.io</a>. It's not the greatest game ever, and it's not even particularly original, but I wanted to get something out there and see what people thought.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And so "GroundHog" was born! To be honest, it was actually the result of a really strange dream I had about a rolling pig game where gravity follows the main character's movements. Hence: a grounded hog. So naturally, like any sane person, I made it into an actual thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, enough rambling for now - if you fancy a go of it, take a look at:&nbsp;<a title="https://tinygoose.itch.io/groundhog" href="https://tinygoose.itch.io/groundhog" target="">https://tinygoose.itch.io/groundhog</a>!</div><div><br></div><div>EDIT: Source code now available at:&nbsp;<a title="https://github.com/tinygooseuk/GroundHog" href="https://github.com/tinygooseuk/GroundHog" target="">https://github.com/tinygooseuk/GroundHog</a>. You won't be able to build and run the game from that as it's missing the project files and assets, but you can see how it was done at least!<br></div>
