        <p>
            Want to use Addressables from scripts, but find yourself using "magic strings" everywhere? You need Addresses!
        </p>

        <p>
            Addresses is a small set of scripts that allow you to easily load assets asynchronously using Unity's Addressables system, without needing to hardcode strings everywhere.
            <br />
            Instead of loading "P_MyCoolestPrefab", load Addresses.Prefabs.Coolest. Or Addresses.Gameplay.Cool. Or whatever you want to call it.
        </p>

            Find it on the Unity Asset Store here!
